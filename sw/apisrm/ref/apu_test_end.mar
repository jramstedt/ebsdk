;	Alpha Update Code
;
;  AUTHORS:
;
;      This is the end macro for update utility. This is 
;      a placeholder so the symbol driver can find the 
;      end of the console image and the beginning of the
;      update utility. At least that is the theory. Since
;      this is at the end of the console image (look at map)
;      the apu_merge code will look for this pattern, and then
;      pad the merging to the next 8192 page boundary, this
;      is so that we can boot from physical memory.
