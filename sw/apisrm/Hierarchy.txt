The directories at this level in the tree are 
  ref - which contains the baseline sources imported from Compaq/Digital
        in a flat directory where all there sources are kept
  pc264 - a platform family directory with two subdirectories:
       src - for any files common to the pc264 family or which differ 
             from the ref sources in a shared way for pc264
       cfg - a directory of platforms that are members of the pc264 family:
           pc264 - Compaq EV6x, Tsunami (6600) platforms (DP264, DS10/20,...)
           sword - API EV6x Slot B, Tsunami platforms (UP2000, UP2000+,...)
           naut  - API EV6x Slot B, Irongate (S2k subset of Tsunami) (UP1000)
           tinosa- API EV6x Slot B, Caspian (S2k ext. of Tsunami) (...)
           shark - API EV6x embedded, Tsunami platforms (...)

Each platform is described by a xxxxx_files.bld file which identifies the 
common files used, the platform family and any common family files, and 
the specific platform name and files used. 

The build process searches three directories to find each file named in 
the xxxxx_files.bld description starting with the family source directory 
"pc264/src", then searching a temporary working source directory 
"src", then the platform specific directory "pc264/cfg/xxxxx", and 
finishing in "ref". The actual setup on VMS can look like this:

   [common.ref]
     *     release baseline files
   [user]
     [.working]
       [.src]
2        *      temporary working files for development (optional)
       [.pc264]
         [.src]
1          *      files generated by newbuild.com for pc264 family
         [.exe]
           *      files generated by mms for pc264 family base (member=family)
         [.obj]
           *      files generated by mms for pc264 family base (member=family)
         [.lis]
           *      files generated by mms for pc264 family base (member=family)
         [.log] 
           *      various working output logs (redirected from scripts) 
         [.cfg]
           [.pc264]
3            *      files generated by newbuild.com for base family member
                    (platform specific are in "ref")
             [.inc]
               *    files generated by newbuild.com for base family member
             [.log] 
               *    various working output logs (redirected from scripts) 

           [.xxxxx]
3            *      files generated by newbuild.com for alt. family member
             *      platform-specific files 
             [.inc]
             *      files generated by newbuild.com for alt. family member
             [.exe]
               *    files generated by mms for alt. family member
             [.obj]
               *    files generated by mms for alt. family member
             [.lis]
               *    files generated by mms for alt. family member
             [.log] 
               *    various working output logs (redirected from scripts) 

The common ref files are maintained from the imported sources while 
the platform specific ones are copied into the pc264/cfg/xxxxx directories.
