Instructions for building PALcode and configuring PALcode


When building a set of PALcode, there are two main files - firstly,
the OSF palcode file which contains all the hardware entry points
and is largely platform independent.  Secondly a system PALcode file
which contains the flesh of the implementation and has many areas where
different actions must be taken for different platforms.

These files are configured by setting predicate variables and definitions
in platform and target configuration files, which contain no code.
